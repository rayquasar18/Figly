## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Collection system (Phase 4) placed early, before search/notifications/messaging, to validate the core differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Stories and Reels deferred to Phases 9-10 as engagement multipliers, not core value
- [Research]: Fan-out-on-write feed architecture from day one to avoid naive query degradation
- [Research]: Async media processing via BullMQ workers mandatory from Phase 1
- [01-01]: Source-only shared package -- TypeScript source imported directly by consuming workspace tooling
- [01-01]: Vietnamese error messages in Zod schemas per user decision
- [01-01]: Dual .env loading for monorepo Prisma CLI compatibility
- [01-01]: Named throttle profiles (short: 100/min, login: 5/min)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Seed data strategy for collection database (Gundam, figurines, sneakers) needs resolution before Phase 4
- [Research]: Video processing cost analysis (self-hosted FFmpeg vs AWS MediaConvert) needed before Phase 10
